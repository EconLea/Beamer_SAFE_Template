# Beamer_SAFE_Template

This repo provides a few variants of a Latex Beamer presentation in "SAFE-style". 

All of theses versions

1) allow you to easily use SAFE's colors, and
2) add SAFE's (and optionally Goethe's) logo to the title slide.

Take a look at the folder "Addon_YourTemplate". 

The folder "styles" contains a simple sty file, which you can either use directly or add the respective lines of code to your current sty file. :smirk:
